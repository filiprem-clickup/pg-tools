pgboom TODO list
================

* support ACLs

* implement "SQL diff" (producing ALTER to patch db).
  Note: this is hard.

* switch to Python "logging" instead of custom "debug" function.

* try to handle object dependencies on explode / implode / cat.

* try to do something smart (overwrite? diff?) with pre-existing objects on implode
